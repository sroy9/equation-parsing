  abstract = {Relational reinforcement learning is presented, a learning technique
	that combines reinforcement learning with relational learning or
	inductive logic programming. Due to the use of a more expressive
	representation language to represent states, actions and Q-functions,
	relational reinforcement learning can be potentially applied to a
	new range of learning tasks. One such task that we investigate is
	planning in the blocks world, where it is assumed that the effects
	of the actions are unknown to the agent and the agent has to learn
	a policy. Within this simple domain we show that relational reinforcement
	learning solves some existing problems with reinforcement learning.
	In particular, relational reinforcement learning allows us to employ
	structural representations, to abstract from specific goals pursued
	and to exploit the results of previous learning phases when addressing
	new (more complex) situations.},

	recently proposed through the well-known Backpropagation algorithm.
	This is a gradient method which can get stuck in local minima, as
	simple examples can show. In this paper, some conditions on the network
	architecture and the learning environment are proposed which ensure
	the convergence of the Backpropagation algorithm. It is proven in
	particular that the convergence holds if the classes are linearly-separable.
	In this case, the experience gained in several experiments shows
	that $MLNs$ exceed perceptrons in generalization to new examples.},

% The file contains Dan Roth's and the Cognitive Computation Group papers
%
%
% The key for an entry should be the concatenation of:
%   (1) The full last name of the first author (first letter capitalized),
%   (2) The first two characters of the last name of each following
%           author (first letter capitalized),
%   (3) The last two digits of the year of the publication, and
%   (4) [Optional] A letter from "bcdefg..." or other text (e.g. volume
%       number) if necessary to yield unique keys.
%
% Example: AhoHoUl74
%
% The entries in this file should be alphabetically sorted by key value.
%
% Entries with more than 3 authors should replace (1) and (2) with
% the first letter of each author's last name, capitalized.



% The bibfile has a number of extensions that are designed to work with
% the DB update scripts and allow its use as a master file for multiple option on the
% Cogcomp group web page.
% Here is a list of the extension and what they do:
%
%    * url: a URL where the publication can be downloaded.
%      All the papers are placed in the /home/roth/danr/public_html/Papers directory on l2r.
%      Publications appear in reverse chronological order (years) and, within a year,
%      in the order they appear in the bibfile.
%    * projects: a list of space or comma-delimited keys for the projects related to the publication.
%      The keys and their respective projects are listed in the projects section below.
%    * funding: a list of keys for the grants which helped to produce the publication.
%      The keys and their respective grants are listed at the top of the bibfile.
%    * comment: a short comment which will be displayed in fixed-width type under the
%      citation for the publication on the group website.
%      This is a good place to put relevant keywords for the paper and to facilitate googling it.
%    * invisible: a way to specify that this entry should not appear on the group web site.
%      say: invisible = {true}. All other values will be assumed to be false.
